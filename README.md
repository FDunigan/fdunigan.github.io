# My Github Portfolio! 

With the help of Start Bootstrap, I made a dynamic portfolio page complete with links to the projects I am most proud to present. 

You can see the site for yourself [here](https://fdunigan.github.io/).

Starting with the template, I manipulated the aesthetics of the page in addition to the clickable links. I changed the background colors of the page, the images associated with each project, the contact section to correspond with my contact information, and the content of each modal. 

Additionally, the buttons at the bottom of the page have been updated so the user can see my Github repository, Twitter page, and LinkedIn profile. 

You will find links in each modal that show both the deployed project and the corresponding code on Github.
